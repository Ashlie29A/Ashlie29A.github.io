    <h2>SEO:</h2>
    <p>The first SEO technique is to utilize descriptive URLs to give users an idea of what they can expect from your site, as well as the pages.
    Google uses some parts of  URL as "breadcrumbs", which can indicate the topic of a page which otherwise would be difficult to interpret if it was a random identifier.
    For example, my portfolio page about my awards is https://ashlie29a.github.io/Ashlie29a.github.io-portfolio/awards.html, if the final identifier wasn't "awards" and something random or a series of numbers, 
    it would be hard for users browsing at first glance to know what that page is about. When searching a query, Google's breadcrumb can show where the pages lead to on a site, therefore it is crucial that URL identifiers are descriptive.</p>
    
    <p>The second SEO technique is to influence and create impactful title elements. This is commonly found in the header portion of the HTML document, and is the main title to show up when a user searches a query.
        For example, I have titled my labs "ITM780 Lab X" and so on, which indicates which lab page the user is viewing. Similarly, for websites the title should indicate and define what the page is about concisely so the user can be informed, and 
        can even become a stronger result if more relevant to the query. I have implemented this within this very page!
    </p>
    <p>The third SEO technique is to include alternative text to high quality, relevant images to make content overall more complete and improve the relationship between the image and the content.
        Search engines can use this alternative text to further interpret content which can then assist in pushing content when users search certain queries. 
        Overall this also helps with accessibility, in the case that images may not load therefore alternative text can provide more context to the image and visuals on the site. </p>

    <div class="seo-implementation">The SEO techniques I implemented within this page is the descriptive title element - noting ITM780 Lab 10.
        Through this title, it is evident that this page corresponds to lab 8 for ITM780. I also included a meta description in the HTML head element, it reads "Lab 10 for ITM780, which describes different SEO & SMO techniques, as well as a few examples and links to the TMU Instagram page."
    </div>

    <div class = "smo-container">
    <h2>SMO:</h2>
    <p>The first SMO technique which assists in growth is to curate a detailed and polished social media bio. 
        When visiting a social media page this is typically the first element a visitor sees, with the most crucial information i.e contact, links, description etc. 
        Therefore, having the website link can assist with SEO & SMO and overall curates a more complete social media profile which can feed into a better visiting experience overall.
        Typically condensed urls or easy to remember/type urls are pasted in bios to allow for a quicker linking experience between social media and websites.</p>
    
    <p>The second SMO technique is to include CTAs, also known as "call to actions". These are action buttons typically like "buy now, subscribe, learn more" etc.
        These CTAs typically launch or link to another page which leads to the transaction or process that the CTA listed, usually prompting the user to perform a certain action.
        Overall this can increase engagement, prompt conversions and can lead to the website which makes for a better user experience overall and if more content is desired they can seek it from there.
    </p>

    <p>The third SMO technique for increasing brand presence is actually analyzing the appropriate time to post while users are active and the most engagement/views are likely to occur.
        If posts are made at times where there is more user activity, more awareness can be created and views on specific posts, thus further amplifying potential site visits.
        Establishing common post times can drive anticipation and expectations, therefore connecting more with users and keeping a brand top of mind for visitors.
