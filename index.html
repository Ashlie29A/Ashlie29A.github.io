    <h2><li>Program</li></h2>
    <p>The Business Technology Management Program is a program that is at the intersection of Business and IT.
    It is a very versatile program but is typically geared towards more analytical and data roles as well as project manager focused careers.
    Currently I am taking 4 courses, 2 of which are mandatory courses for the program (ITM750 & ITM707), 1 core elective (ITM780) and 1 open elective (GCM738).
    <blockquote>A course I would consider most useful thus far is ITM100 as the Excel software taught in the course has played a key role in my career and is a common tool I use most frequently in my day-to-day.
    For my program, and all the work terms I have completed, Excel has played a vital role and the course had taught me new skills that I wouldn't have known otherwise.</blockquote></p>
